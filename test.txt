I've called... = present perfectWe use the present perfect to talk about unfinished time periods.So, we can't say 'I've called...yesterday' (because yesterday is finished)'Today' is unfinished, so it's the only possible answer.

'Can' is used here because we are talking about a general possibility.The other three (could/may/might) are only used for specific possibilities, at one moment in time.

1) 'The bag' because I think you know which bag I'm talking about 2) 'The table' for the same reason - probably there's only one table in the room where we are 3) 'An apple' because I want one apple, but I don't care which apple you give me. Probably, this means there are several apples which both people can see. 4) 'A bar of chocolate' is similar to (3)

going
will
to
going to
4
'Going to' and 'will' can both be used to make predictions, but in this sentence, 'it's' means we can't use 'will'.Otherwise, you could say 'Do you think it will rain tomorrow?' with no difference in meaning.
Question 19

will
'm going to

want to

We use this form to talk about a situation which is imaginary or unreal:If + past simple --> would + infinitiveIn this case, the situation is unreal because I don't have time, so I can't do more exercise.

'Exhausted' has a strong meaning, so we can only use certain adverbs.In the same way, you can't say 'I was completely tired', because 'completely' can only be used with adjectives which have a strong meaning.

Adjectives of opinion (like 'beautiful') go before adjectives of fact (like 'long' and 'black').If you have several adjectives, they need to go in a certain order. There is a rule (although it's too complicated to remember when you're speaking) - the best way is to use your instinct: if one way sounds better, then it probably is better.
Question 25
I'm busy on Friday, so I ________ come
can't
don't
am not
not can
1
'I don't come' = regularly, many times, so it doesn't go here, because we're talking about one time (this Friday).We use 'can' + 'not' = 'can't' or 'cannot' ('can't' is more common in spoken English).
Question 26

would have arrived, would have missed

Question 31
The film ________ by Quentin Tarantino
was direct

2
This is the passive voice, which is used to change the emphasis of a sentence. So here, we use the passive because we want to emphasise the film, not the director.
Question 32
It was the first time he ________ anything so spicy
had eaten
had been eating
was eating
has eaten
1
We use the past perfect because we have two past actions.It was (1) the first time he had eaten (2) anything so spicy.The past perfect shows that (2) happened before (1).
Question 33
I drink coffee ________
twice a day
two times for a day

Question 36

This situation is imaginary: I am imagining being in your position. To describe an imaginary situation, we use the past simple after 'if'.Also, in these sentences, we can use 'were' to replace 'was'. Most of the time, you can choose which to use:"If I was rich and famous..." "If I were rich and famous..."--> Both okBut, in this sentence 'If I were you...', we always use 'were'.
